typ (Test Your Program)
=======================

typ is a simple program for testing Python code and standalone binaries.

For testing Python code, it supports test discovery, parallel test execution,
clean logging of progress and results in the style of the Ninja build tool,
integrated code coverage, and debugging (pdb) support.

This is still a work in progress. The Python functionality should work fine.
I need to add in the command-line testing functionality (ported over from
the scaffolding in pyn), and add tests.
