pytest
======

pytest is a simple python testing wrapper. It is not related to the
pytest from pytest.org (if I ever want to get people to use this, I
clearly need to change the name).

It supports simple test discovery, parallel test execution, clean
logging of progress and results in the style of the Ninja build tool,
and integrated code coverage support.
